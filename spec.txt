When current line goes over line boundary then insert new line at beginning of
word (checking that word itself isn't greater than the line length).

When words are deleted then reflow the current "paragraph" (loose term as
different in different contexts). If sufficiently accurate then can make this
automatic otherwise bound to keyboard shortcut.

When overflow is part of comment then need to reflow comment section
automatically.

Only overflow in text/comment regions.

Streaming:
 - is range overflowing?
 - is range at end of logical section (we don't want to reflow entire section
   automatically)
 - Seek back until beginning of word is found and then replace range with one
   that includes new line (replacing entire range to ensure that event is fired
   again if there are still overflows).

gq:
 - Get section buffer range.
 - Search through buffer line by line: if underflow then make overflow by adding
   next line until overflows.
 - if overflow then "fix" overflow.
 - replace part of section that changed.

If gq is good enough then it can be enabled for streaming.
